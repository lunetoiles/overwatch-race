## FAQ

#### How do I start? I'm stuck in the spawn room!

Press your ultimate button (defaults to Q). This will spawn you into the race.

#### I messed up, how to I restart?

You can press ultimate (default Q) again during a run to restart.

#### What is this options circle?

You canchange a couple options for the game. Enter the circle and an interface will pop up. Press left and right click to select options and press Interact(F) to toggle them

The options are:
- Option 1: skip countdown at start of race.
- Option 2: Replace top 5 times with a speedrunning style split display. Checkpoints that start the next split will be blue instead of purple.
- Option 3: When using the speedrun split display, compare agains the server best run instead of your personal best.
 

#### How do I make my own map?

You can create your own map by using the "Map maker" and "Gather room editor" codes below, and entering the data into the first 4 rules of the workshop mode. Detailed instructions are [on the wiki](https://github.com/lunetoiles/overwatch-race/wiki/How-to-make-a-new-map).

These instructions are unfortunately a bit out of date, but if you do want to make one please message me on Discord and I will update the instructions and help you with any questions you have.
